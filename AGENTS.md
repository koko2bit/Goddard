# Workspace Agent Notes

- These rules apply repo-wide unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` adds or narrows rules for its subtree.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for short, easy-to-miss instructions. Put long-form contribution or implementation guidance in `goddard-contributor`.
- Before editing a subtree, read the root and nearest local `AGENTS.md`.
- Update `AGENTS.md` when a human gives durable guidance future agents should follow.

## Repository State

- This repo is unreleased and pre-alpha.
- Backwards compatibility is not required.
- Prefer the simplest forward-looking design.
- Do not add legacy compatibility paths, deprecation shims, or fallback behavior unless explicitly asked.

## Shared Behavior Rules

- Any new user-facing capability added in `app/` that depends on shared data loading, shared data mutation, or system configuration must also be implemented in `core/sdk/` in the same PR.
- UI-only behavior does not require `core/sdk/` parity. Do not replicate presentation-only features, interaction affordances, or UI configuration in the SDK.
- Do not ship `app/` ahead of `core/sdk/` when the feature depends on shared data or system configuration. If `core/sdk/` cannot support that behavior yet, treat the `app/` work as incomplete.
- When adding new UI components or interactive elements in `app/`, use the local `pandark-ui` skill to align Panda CSS and Ark UI composition with the existing design system.
- `spec/` is the canonical source of product behavior and intent.
- Do not edit `spec/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not knowingly let code, docs, or tests diverge from `spec/`.
- If a request conflicts with `spec/`, call it out instead of silently working around it.

## Code Style And Patch Discipline

- Make the smallest correct change. Preserve existing architecture, naming, and file layout unless the task requires refactoring.
- Prefer readability and local reasoning over new abstractions.
- Avoid extracting local helpers that are only used once; prefer inline logic until reuse or a clear readability win justifies abstraction.
- Do not declare explicit function return types.
- Add human-readable `/** ... */` description comments to:
  - exported modules
  - non-trivial top-level functions
  - TypeScript type aliases and interfaces, except types inferred from a same-name Zod schema
- Comments should explain the non-obvious what or why. Do not add `@param` or `@returns` boilerplate, and do not restate the code.
- Maintain code comments when editing nearby logic. If a change makes an existing comment stale, update or remove the comment in the same patch.
- Add a short comment when it materially improves reviewability. A comment qualifies only if all of the following are true:
  - it explains a correctness-relevant fact that is not obvious from local names, types, and control flow
  - without the comment, a reviewer would likely need to inspect another file, spec, test, protocol, or bug history to understand why the code is correct
  - the explanation fits in 1-3 lines and states the non-obvious why, invariant, or constraint
- Typical cases for reviewability comments:
  - hidden invariants or preconditions
  - intentional asymmetry or surprising branch/order dependence
  - protocol, wire-format, persistence, or API contract constraints
  - workarounds for external tool, platform, or library behavior
  - edge-case handling where the failure mode is not locally obvious
- Do not add comments that merely narrate the code, restate names/types, or compensate for code that should instead be renamed or simplified.
- Minimize churn: touch as few files as possible, avoid unrelated cleanup or formatting, and do not rename or move files unless necessary.
- If refactoring is required for correctness, keep it mechanical and separate from behavior changes when possible.
- When uncertain, follow the existing local pattern with the lowest architectural impact.

## Git

- Use Conventional Commits: `<type>(optional-scope): <description>`.
- Commit requested changes without waiting for a separate prompt to commit them.
- Keep commits atomic, single-purpose, concise, and imperative.
- Split docs-only or policy-only changes from behavior or test changes unless they are inseparable.
- Include a body in every commit that explains why the change exists.
- When the reason is known or can be inferred without guessing, the body should capture the motivating intent for the change.
- Record important context, constraints, or tradeoffs that would help the next agent understand the decision.
- Call out notable side effects, risks, or migration notes when they exist.
- Link issues, tickets, or design docs when they add useful context.
- In non-interactive terminals, set `GIT_EDITOR=true` for commands that would otherwise open an editor.

## Testing

- When running the full workspace test suite from the repository root, use `bun run test`.
- Do not use `bun test` at the repository root; it bypasses the workspace package test scripts and monorepo orchestration.

## Documentation Routing

- Read the nearest `glossary.md` before changing domain behavior, naming, states, roles, identifiers, or ownership rules in a package that has one.
- Put package boundaries and integration surfaces in the nearest `README.md`.
- Put domain terminology in the nearest `glossary.md`.
- Put long-form contribution guidance that does not belong in `AGENTS.md` in `goddard-contributor`.
- Use repository-relative paths when printing workspace paths.
- Keep each `AGENTS.md` short, scannable, and scoped to its directory tree.
- Do not use `AGENTS.md` as a spec, plan, backlog, or changelog.
- When guidance outgrows an `AGENTS.md`, move it to a better-scoped document and leave a short pointer.
